Pock
====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rollenes/pock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rollenes/pock)

HTTP mocking library for PHP inspired by [nock](https://github.com/pgte/nock)(nodejs).

This proof of concept is based on idea to intercept all http based communication.

To make interceptions possible [pachwork](http://antecedent.github.io/patchwork/) is used.
